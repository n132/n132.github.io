I am Xiang (Neil) Mei, a Ph.D. student at Arizona State University, working with [Dr. Yan Shoshitaishvili][17] (advisor), [Dr. Ruoyu (Fish) Wang][18], [Dr. Adam Doupé][19], and [Dr. Tiffany Bao][20] in the [SEFCOM lab][16]. My research primarily revolves around automated binary analysis, vulnerability discovery, and exploitation. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned my Master’s degree from NYU in 2023, where I conducted research (currently under submission) with [Dr. Brendan Dolan-Gavitt][15].


Since my sophomore year, I have been actively engaged in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions. I compete as part of [Shellphish][12] and [r3kapig][13] teams under the handle n132, specializing in binary exploitation (PWN). Recently, I became the tenth person to solve all challenges on [Pwnable.tw][11], a journey that spanned seven years and built my exploitation skills. Moreover, I have been a [DEF CON CTF][10] finalist with team r3kapig since 2021. During my master's study at NYU, I served as the Lab Manager for [NYU Osiris Lab][9], organizing [CSAW-CTFs][8] in 2021 and 2022. It's also worth mentioning that, I exploited the WYZE-V3 camera at [PWN2OWN][7] Toronto in 2023.


I am an advocate for open-source, contributing to major projects like the [Linux kernel][5] and [how2heap][6]. I share various exploitation tools and techniques I develop on my [GitHub][4], including [Libc-GOT-Hijacking][1], [Dec-Safe-Linking][2], [BeapOverflow][3], and [more][4].
