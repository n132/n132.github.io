# Intro
It's a challenge based on [sandboxed-api@google][2], which is a c/c++ library. With this library, we can apply our sandbox policy to a executor (program). While running, the sandbox would monitor the syscalls of sandboxee(the running progress in sandbox). 

The following code is the source code of the challenge and in this challenge, our goal is writing a program and use it read a file in the sandbox with limited syscalls.

```c++
...
int main() {
    ...
  int fd = ReadBinary();
  std::string path = absl::StrCat("/proc/", getpid(), "/fd/", fd);
  auto policy = sandbox2::PolicyBuilder()
    .AllowStaticStartup()
    .AllowFork()
    .AllowSyscalls({
      __NR_seccomp,
      __NR_ioctl,
    })
    .AllowExit()
    .AddFile(sapi::file_util::fileops::MakeAbsolute("flag", sapi::file_util::fileops::GetCWD()))
    .AddDirectory("/dev")
    .AddDirectory("/proc")
    .AllowUnrestrictedNetworking()
    .BuildOrDie();
  std::vector<std::string> args = {"sol"};
  auto executor = std::make_unique<sandbox2::Executor>(path, args);
  sandbox2::Sandbox2 sandbox(std::move(executor), std::move(policy));
  sandbox2::Result result = sandbox.Run();
  if (result.final_status() != sandbox2::Result::OK) {
    warnx("Sandbox2 failed: %s", result.ToString().c_str());
  }
}
```

In main function, the program would read binary from users and run the program with the sandbox policy.  As you can see, it's quite simple. We don't even have some basic syscalls, such as open, read, and write. However, we have some extra syscalls to help us escape from the sandbox, including fork, clone, seccomp, ioctl. It's actually a great hint of the challenge but I didn't notice that. 


## Background Knowledge

It's known that we can't use `SYS_seccomp` to change applied bpf rules.
