# 0x00 Prologue

This is a challenge in the zer0pts CTF 2022. It's pity that I didn't solve it in the game, but it's supper worthy to write a single post for this challenge. I learned a lot in this challenge, including some unrelated knowledge. Yeah, I tried tons of wrong ways to solve it. And the official solution is really innovative for me, I guessed that but to be honest, I can't confirm it because I never met this type of exploitation. It's a long story, let's start the awesome trip!

# 0x01 Analysis

[attachment][1]


zer0pts gives the full set-up environment, including the source code. I think this type of pure pwn is better for some challenges cuz people could reproduce the challenge easily.
```C
int main() {
  ...
  if (cpid == 0) {

    /* Child process: sandboxed */
    close(c2p[0]);
    close(p2c[1]);
    setup_sandbox();
    child_note(c2p[1], p2c[0], ppid);

  } else {

    /* Parent process: unsandboxed */
    close(c2p[1]);
    close(p2c[0]);
    parent_note(c2p[0], p2c[1], cpid);
    wait(NULL);

  }
}
```
In the main function, the program would create two processes, child and parent. And use the pipe to implement the communication between the child and parent process. Also, the child process is protected by the bpf sandbox.

## sandbox

I used the `seccomp-tools` to check the sandbox rules. This bpf is good in my view because it bans the i386 syscalls and large syscalls(+0x40000000). And find there is a black list of syscalls. This looks like a point we can use later. 
```sh
$bin seccomp-tools dump ./chall
 line  CODE  JT   JF      K
=================================

 0015: 0x15 0x03 0x00 0x000000ea  if (A == tgkill) goto 0019
 0016: 0x15 0x02 0x00 0x00000136  if (A == process_vm_readv) goto 0019
 0017: 0x15 0x01 0x00 0x00000137  if (A == process_vm_writev) goto 0019
 0018: 0x06 0x00 0x00 0x7fff0000  return ALLOW
 0019: 0x06 0x00 0x00 0x00000000  return KILL
```

One key of this challenge is the backlist filter, I guessed that the author may want to share with us some attacking skills with some syscalls. But I failed to find that syscall during the game. In the game, I thought, that syscall may be related to the process control so I go through all the syscalls that have PID-related parameters and all the syscalls related to the "open".

## Interface and Core
```c
void child_note(int c2p, int p2c, int ppid) {
  int res;
  request_t req;
  uint64_t value;

  print("1. new\n");
  print("2. set\n");
  print("3. get\n");
  ...
}
```
In the sandbox, the child process would provide an interface of the parent process. There is a manual in the child process. The child would take the input from the user. According to different inputs, the child process would generate a call different functions on the parent process. Btw, there is a buffer overflow in the child process but we can't use it to get the flag because of the sandbox. 

For this type of challenge, we usually try to control the child and make it to be a bad boy so that we can use it to send some evil api calls to trigger the vulnerability in the parent process. 

```c
  while (1) {
    if (read(c2p, &req, sizeof(req)) != sizeof(req))
      return;

    switch (req.cmd)
    {
      /* Create new buffer */
      case NEW: {
    ...
```

For the parent process, it would take the message from its child and parse it. But in my view, the parsing part is secure and there are so many checks to prevent bad value. There is no trust between this father and son.

```c
        ...
        old = buffer;
        if (!(buffer = (uint64_t*)malloc(req.size * sizeof(uint64_t)))) {
          /* Memory error */
          size = -1;
          RESPONSE(-1);
          break;
        }
        ...
```

But something strange catches my attention after reading the code for 3 hours. In the `new` feature, the size could be set to -1 and it's an `unsigned int` which means we could write/read arbitrary address by `SET/GET`. However, the story is not such easy. 

I spent another 3 hours reviewing the malloc's source code to find a way to return the "NULL". In my memory, malloc would return a negative number on fail and return the address of the chunk if it works properly. And these 3 hours prove that we have no way to return a 0 by constructing a bad child call.

```c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <unistd.h>
enum Command {NEW, SET, GET};

typedef struct {
  enum Command cmd;
  union {
    size_t size;
    off_t index;
  };
  uint64_t value;
} request_t;

void parent_note(char *buf,size_t len) {
  int res;
  request_t req;

  uint64_t *old, *buffer = (uint64_t*)malloc(0);
  size_t size = 0;
  size_t p = 0;
  while (len>=0x18) {
    if (memcpy(&req,(char *)(buf+p),sizeof(req))!= sizeof(req))
    {
        free(buffer);
        return;
    }
    p += sizeof(req);
    if(p+0x18>=len)
    {
        free(buffer);
        return;
    }
    switch (req.cmd)
    {
      /* Create new buffer */
      case NEW: {
        if (req.size > 2800) {
          /* Invalid size*/
          //RESPONSE(-1);
          break;
        }

        /* Allocate new buffer */
        old = buffer;
        if (!(buffer = (uint64_t*)malloc(req.size * sizeof(uint64_t)))) {
          /* Memory error */
          size = -1;
          //RESPONSE(-1);
          //free(old);
          break;
        }

        /* Prevent memory leak */
        free(old);

        /* Update size */
        size = req.size;

        //RESPONSE(0);
        break;
      }

      /* Set value */
      case SET: {
        if (req.index < 0 || req.index >= size) {
          /* Invalid index */
          //RESPONSE(-1);
          break;
        }

        /* Set value */
        buffer[req.index] = req.value;

        //RESPONSE(0);
        break;
      }

      /* Get value */
      case GET: {
        if (req.index < 0 || req.index >= size) {
          /* Invalid index */
          //RESPONSE(-1);
          break;
        }
        //RESPONSE(0);

        /* Send value */
        //write(p2c, &buffer[req.index], sizeof(uint64_t));
        break;
      }

      default:
        free(buffer);
        return;
    }
  }
  free(buffer);
  return;
}

int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(char *Data, size_t Size) {
  parent_note(Data, Size);
  return 0;
}
```
And I even wrote a fuzzer for parent's code. The result shows it's secure.

# 0x02 Solution

0. Leak the libc base. we can use it in the parent process because the child process would inherit the memory layout of the parent.
1. Use Buffer overflow to control the child process
2. Use some syscall in child to make parent's malloc return 0
3. Send some api call to write/read arbitrary addresses to hijack the parent process

We can combine two parts, the blacklist-filter, and the `size=-1` to generate the above solution but I can't implement it during the game because I can't find a syscall to limit the parent process and I find the keystone of my solution in the official exp. That's a syscall I missed in the game, prlimit64.

# 0x03 limit a process

Let's start from the man page of this syscall/function.

```c
int prlimit(pid_t pid, int resource, const struct rlimit *new_limit,
                   struct rlimit *old_limit);
```

Prlimit has 4 paremeters, ths first is easy to understand the target pid.
```c
struct rlimit {
               rlim_t rlim_cur;  /* Soft limit */
               rlim_t rlim_max;  /* Hard limit (ceiling for rlim_cur) */
           };
```
The `struct rlimit` has two `unsigned long` elements, `rlim_cur` which represents the soft limit and `rlim_max` which is the hard limit. The hard limit is the limit of the soft limit, aka the soft limit should be lower than the hard limit. And the soft limit is the real limit to the resource. 

By setting the second parameter, we can limit different types of resources of a process, such as CPU time/core, Address Space. And there are some of them are memory-related, including
`RLIMIT_STACK`, `RLIMIT_DATA`, and `RLIMIT_AS`.

For `RLIMIT_STACK` the `prlimit` could limit the stack size and would generate a SIGSEGV when the stack is oversize.

If we set the stack size to 0 and try to allocate more stacks we would successfully get the SIGSEGV. I don't have a good utility of the stack limitation while for `RLIMIT_DATA` and `RLIMIT_AS` we could return a NULL from the malloc or mmap. Btw, this NULL return value could only trigger by calling mmap and brk. Also, we could re-call prlimit to remove the limitation by setting rlim_cur to a very large number(rlim_cur is less than rlim_max).

```c
#include <sys/resource.h>
#include <sys/time.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

int main()
{
        struct rlimit *new = malloc(sizeof(struct rlimit));
        new->rlim_cur = 0;
        new->rlim_max = 0;
        unsigned int res = prlimit(getpid(),RLIMIT_DATA,new,NULL);
        printf("%d\n",res);
        res = malloc(0x22222);
        printf("%d\n",res);
        return 0;
}
```

Moreover, I find `RLIMIT_FSIZE` may result in open failure and return a `-1`. Therefore, a return value check is necessary.

I also noticed that not only the parent and child process could limit each other, but a normal user's process could influence another process in userspace. A very interesting feature!

# 0x04 Exploit Script

1. The `malloc` chunk would include some garbage data, which could leak the libc base
2. Use gadget in the glibc to perform rop: `mmap`, `read` shellcode, jump to shellcode
3. Call `prlimit64` to limit the address space
4. Back to `child_note` and trigger the vulnerability to change the size to `-1`. My method is a little verbose. I trigger the `brk` by reallocating the top chunk.
5. Hijack the `__free_hook` in parent process
6. Call `prlimit64` to remove the limit
7. Malloc and free to RCE

# 0x05 Summary

This challenge is interesting, cuz before the first blood was got by `Shellphish` I can't believe it's solvable and I did check the attachment so many times, lol. Yeah, after solving this, I think there are enough clues left in the challenge, the blacklist, and the meaningless `-1` for unsigned int. This challenge is not complex but educational and it's a good challenge in my view.

Another fun fact, this type of vulnerability is not likely found by the fuzzer. Because the fuzzer can't even trigger the branch! I believe there are so many of these types of vulnerabilities in the real world. And this challenge's solution introduces a new way to implement some "impossible" attacking.

Anyway, glad to play with this challenge, thanks zer0pts!
