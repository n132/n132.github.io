# 0CTF-2022

The easy challenges don't deserve a write-up and I'll post the solution to unsolved challenges later (next year, lol) :)!

# Epilogue

I played 0CTF/TCTF this weekend and solved two easy challenges(ezvm&babyheap) but I spend more than 20 hours on the other two challenges(qqbot&babysnitch) and failed to solve them. Also, I clearly see that I need to spend more time learning new skills(browser, sandbox) and new languages(rust, go). 

I spent almost all my weekends and leisure time on CTF games. 
However, CTF is just a part of my life and I feel so tired after CTF weekends cuz I am too excited to have enough sleep during the game.

And I may don't have enough energy to continue the other parts of my life. So I decided to focus on my life and stop playing CTF until May 2023(at least).  I would focus on my courses, prepare for my applications, continue research, and enjoy the fantastic world! 

I'll come back and see yall then!
